*research and community-based performative installation in two parts + publication (in progress)  
as a member of [the Cooperative for Creative Research Krasnaya Shpana](http://shpana.tk){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with Kampnagel Kulturfabrik  
Hamburg, Germany, October 2017 â€“ April 2019*

Krasnaya Shpana goes to Hamburg to engage with local Russian speaking communities and reflect upon the nationalization of historical avant-garde art (its usage as a building block for national identity in Russia and Ukraine) and disputes it led to. The goal is to make a collective exhibition and performance that will demystify the contemporaneity, the policies and politics behind the idea of the nation state.

Krasnaya Shpana is willing to reconnect those communities and provoke communication in the situation where everyday language is so politically charged and defined that no communication is possible (except, perhaps, a hate speech). For this Krasnaya Shpana is going to apply the creative research method.

The creative research practice is aimed to profanate both art and research by encouraging people from various backgrounds engage in creative process together. This essentially performative process which emerges in the intersection of creative-artistic and research practices can provide some less obvious ways for doing politics as well as give access to additional means for communication and production and sharing of knowledge. 

The Co-operative for Creative Research Krasnaya Shpana is a nomadic collective that currently consists of three members: Alexey Markin, Olga Shirokostup and Illia Yakovenko who are based in Hamburg, Moscow and Kyiv. The cooperative is focused on variety of problematics, especially on (post/de)colonial issues in Russia and Ukraine.
