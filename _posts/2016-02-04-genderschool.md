Moscow Experimental School for Gender Studies is an educational-cum-activist initiative for production of social debates on feminism, queer and gender theory. The program includes intensives, lectures, seminars, screenings Q&As, performances, and assemblies. The very structure of educational process aspires to question not only the division of people according to their gender roles, but challenge any hierarchies as such including hierarchies in academic and intellectual community, epistemology of the process of knowledge production and dissemination. Our aim is to introduce a series of topics that are often suppressed, to give a chance to speak publicly for those who have no right for doing so in contemporary Russian society. Sex, body – everything that at the first sight looks private – becomes the instrument of manipulation and repression of power, if it is kept silent. We do not want to keep silent. Among the participants: Oleg Aronson, Tatyana Antoshina, Mila Bredikhina, Mika Ela, Andrey Parshikov, Helen Petrovskaya, Irina Zherebkina.
