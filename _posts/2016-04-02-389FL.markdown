In neoliberal society Power claims itself not explicitly, but through the system of sophisticated relations, it functions while being dispersed in media, language, culture, governmental and social institutes, etc. (M. Foucault)
Bureaucracy is one of the basic mechanism that is used to govern our lives. And one of its basic institutes - the institute of citizenship. One being recognized as a human only when one is a citizen. But the mechanism that includes has presupposition to exclude or to non-include. In this cases one becomes a Homo Sacer, falls into the Agamben’s notion of Bare Life - a life where one is no more recognized as a human and has almost no rights.  
I’m facing this kind of issue while I’m a Ukrainian citizen that lives in Russia. This work became the reaction on new legislative that was implied in Russia in the beginning of 2014, and made life of many migrants much harsher, shifting a lot of them into illegal condition to ban from 3 up to 5 years afterwards. The work tends to visually investigate how such kind of power institute objectifies a person and its life.
