The State Tretyakov Gallery  
Moscow, 2013*   

As we all know there was no sex in the USSR. Representation of individual sexualities was replaced by the eros of collective aspiration. “The agapian eros of the collective entity was primer for the soviet art, while individual pleasure appeared to be placed into a periphery.” (Keti Chukhrov, Were there a place for Gender in the USSR?). In the soviet sculpture images of sexual body were aimed to erect individual aspiration to later direct the transgressive potential it produced into libido of the collective body. The body was extremely ideologized - by watching it a person couldn’t enjoy the body itself, but only aspire the idea this body was representing. The idea that was appropriated not by the society, but by the power.   
This work involves one of the soviet era’s most representative sculptures which are part of the Tretyakov’s gallery main exposition. It tends to deideologize aesthetics - to return sexuality to individual body and purge all ideological pathos, thereby to expose implicit relations between an individual and power, between aesthetics and ideology.
