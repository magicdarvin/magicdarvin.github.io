Is it possible to explain to a group of random people in just one gathering what is Gender and what relation does it have to their life? To affect a person in such a way, so s/he questioned its own identity and tried to understand itself in the relation to the surrounding context? Purged the line between personal and political? Every week we go out on the streets bearing an aim to gather a group of random people. We locate ourselves in different public spaces carrying the cardboards where “Gender in an hour” is written. With everyone who demonstrates his/her interest we arrange a meeting and gather afterwards as a group at prearranged time and place. Most of the visitors see each other at the first time. We have near an hour to hold an exercise, that will be an answer to raised above questions.   
We believe that the person who concieve itself in relation to power falls into antagonism with it. One of the main causes of current situation in Russia with its reactionary, conservative turn not only in the governmental politics but in the heads of the population itself is taking place due absolute absence of the subjects related to critical thinking e.g. gender theory, post-colonial theory and their derivatives in dominant educational institutes. In fact this institutes are appropriated by the government that seeks to get monopoly for mass production of knowledge. The system of traditional values is used as a base to produce such type of culture that would conceal a gap between the reach and the poor, between the exploiters and those who are exploited. In the established political conditions, where we cannot influence dominant educational institutions directly, we have no options left but to constitute alternative educational practices by ourselves.
